The attributes section for items made with MythicMobs handles the Minecraft attribute system.
It makes it possible to apply different attributes given to the entity wearing/using the item depending on the slot.

[[_TOC_]]

## Format
```yml
Item:
  Id: item_id
  Attributes:
    [Slot]:
      [Attribute]: [value] <operation> 
```


## Slots

- To input an absolute value, simply write it out
```yaml
      Damage: 10 ADD
```
- To input a relative value, use a % symbol after it
```yaml

## Attributes
These are all the available attributes that can be put on the item.
You can use general placeholders like `<random.#to#>` or `<random.float.#to#>`.  
Most of the explanations on this page are excerpts from the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki). You can find out more information about these attributes by looking at [Their page regarding them](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Attribute#Attributes)

## Examples
This example item will grant +10 luck when the item is held in the main hand, but will grant +7 luck and +2 extra damage if the item is held in
the offhand slot:
```yml
lucky_charms:
  Id: potato_item
  Display: 'Rotten Lucky Charm'
  Attributes:
    MainHand:
      Luck: 10
    OffHand:
      Luck: 7
      Damage: 2
```
This example item grants +2 extra health no matter which slot the item is being held, but will also grant +4% movement speed if the item is worn in the feet slot:
```yml
happy_feet:
  Id: leather_boots
  Display: 'Penguin Hide'
  Attributes:
    All:
      Health: 2
    Feet:
      MovementSpeed: 0.04
```
Each time this item is generated it will have a random damage value between 3 and 5 and a random speed bonus between 1% and 5% when worn in the main hand:
```yml
lucky_sword:
  Id: wood_sword
  Display: '<yellow>Lucky Sword</yellow>'
  Attributes:
    MainHand:
      Damage: 3-5
      MovementSpeed: 0.01-0.05 MULTIPLY_BASE
```
