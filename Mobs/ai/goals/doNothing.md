## Description
\*\***This is a Premium only feature**\*\*<br>
Causes the mob to stop doing anything based on provided conditions.

**It seems conditions are reversed when using this, for example `day true` will make the mob doNothing if it is night time, and `day false` will make the mob doNothing if its day time.**
