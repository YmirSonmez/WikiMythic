All options available when creating a mob. Most of these options go under the `Options` section, like so:
```yml
Dummy:
  Type: skeleton
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
    PreventSunburn: true
```

##
- [Universal Options](/Mobs/Options#universal-options)
- [Group Specific Options](/Mobs/Options#group-specific-options)

Defaults to `false`.
```yml
  Options:
    Invisible: true
```

#### Collidable

the entity colliders to ensure that no collisions takes place but will also stop the player from pushing the mob. Defaults to `true`.

  Options:
    Collidable: true
```

This option should be turned on if you're using a lot of mob spawners or entities will overwhelm your server, or the entity you are making requires some special behavior regarding its despawn policy (Npcs, Bosses etc.)  
Defaults to `true`.

> For the PERSISTENT despawn mode: to remove a persistent mob, you have to either use the kill command (`/mm m kill <type>`) or append the `-p` flag to the killall one (`/mm m killall -p`). More information on the subject can be found [here](/Commands-and-Permissions#mob-commands).

```yml
  Options:

    KnockbackResistance: 0.5

Defaults to `false`.
```yml
  Options:
    NoAI: false
```

#### NoDamageTicks
Defines how long in ticks the mob is invulnerable after taking damage.

```yaml
#This mob will always return to 50 health every time the death event is cancelled
ExampleMob:
  Type: COW
