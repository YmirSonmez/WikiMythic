# AI Goal Selectors
Goal Selectors are used with the AIGoalSelectors field and determine what mobs want to “do”. Certain custom goals might not work if they're not included in the base AI of the mob you're creating. For example, a zombie won't be able to use the AI goal “EatGrass” because a zombie would never use that goal in the first place. Feel free to experiment to figure out what does and doesn't work!

Note: Certain goals will not work correctly if the world is in peaceful mode.

Example:

```yaml
SuperMob:
  Type: zombie
  Health: 200
  Display: 'Superb Zombie'
  AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - meleeattack
  - randomstroll
```

This zombie would attack players, and walk around randomly when not targeting an enemy.

# AI Target Selectors
Target Selectors are used with the AITargetSelectors field and determine what mobs try to target.

> If the mob has AITargets but not AIGoal that allows them to act based on their target, they will *still* be considered to have valid targets chosen according to the AITargets used (so, for instance, a @target targeter can be used and so on)

Example
```yaml
SuperMob:
  Type: zombie
  Health: 200
  Display: 'Superb Zombie'
  AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - meleeattack
  - randomstroll
  AITargetSelectors:
  - clear
  - players
  - golems
```
