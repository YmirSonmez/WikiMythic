Mob levels are a useful function for adding levels to your mob, which allow for several useful features.

For example, you can have the mob's damage and health scale up as their level increases, or you can have them drop more items depending on what their level is (see _BonusLevelItems_ in [Droptable Options](/drops/DropTables#droptable-options)).

Or, for more advanced configs you could change their drops completely depending on what level they are, give them different skills depending on their level, or even change where/how they spawn depending on what level they are (using spawners and randomspawns.)

Mob levels can also be influenced by world scaling (see below), [Random
Spawners](/Random%20Spawns) or the [SetLevel
mechanic](/skills/mechanics/setlevel).

```yaml
Zombie:
  Type: zombie
  Health: 100
  Damage: 10
  Display: '&5Zombie Lvl - <caster.level>'
  Options:
    MovementSpeed: 0.3
  Drops:
  - myDroptable
  LevelModifiers:
    Health: 5
    Damage: 0.5
```

# LevelModifiers

These options, put under the LevelModifiers section, will increase the
mobs respective stats by the given numbers per level. These stats will
be added on top of their base stats.

Level modifiers may not work if you didn't specify base values
for the affected attributes in the mob configuration.
```yaml
  LevelModifiers:
    Health: [number]
    Damage: [number]
    KnockbackResistance: [number]
    Power: [number]
    Armor: [number]
    MovementSpeed: [number]
```

# World Scaling

Mob levels (for random-spawned mobs) can automatically be set by the plugin by specifying world scaling settings located in `/MythicMobs/config/config-mobs.yml`. Setting it up is simple. By default the section for scaling in your config-mobs.yml should look something like this:
```yaml
  MobLeveling:
    # Used to scale a mob's attributes as they level up
    ScalingEquations:
      Health: V * ((1.05)^(L-1))
      Damage: V * ((1.05)^(L-1))
      Scale: V
    # Alternate legacy method of scaling mobs attributes
    DefaultLevelModifiers:
      Health: 0.1
      Armor: 0
      Damage: 0
      KnockbackResistance: 0
      Power: 0
    # Per-world scaling options
    WorldScaling:
      Default:
        Enabled: true
        ScaleVanillaMobs: true
        PerBlocksFromSpawn: 250
      world2:
        Enabled: true
        PerBlocksFromSpawn: 250
      world2_nether:
        Enabled: false
        PerBlocksFromSpawn: 100
```
The above examples shows different worlds with different levels of scaling. Using "world2" as an example, the levels for randomspawned mobs would look something like this:

-   Level 0 in the white area (0-249 blocks from spawn).
-   Level 1 in the tan area (250-499 blocks distance).
-   Level 2 in the yellow area (500-749 blocks distance).
-   Level 3 in the orange area (750-999 blocks distance).
-   Level 4 in the red area (1000-1249 blocks distance).
-   Etc.

These options will automatically be applied to all mobs that are summoned into the game using MythicMobs' [Random Spawning](Random-Spawns). You can use the **UseWorldScaling: \[true/false\]** option on your randomspawn configurations to control whether mobs are supposed to be affected by world scaling.

> Note that world scaling options will never affect [Vanilla Overrides](Vanilla-Overrides) unless the `ScaleVanillaMobs` option for that world is set to `true`.
