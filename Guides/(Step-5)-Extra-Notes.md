Hopefully the getting started guide gives you a good idea of how everything works and where to use things. You should read through the wiki and familiarize yourself with each section so that when the time comes that you need something, you are able to find it.

# Troubleshooting
Any issues you come across can be troubleshooted using the information found in this page

[Troubleshooting](/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting)

# Bugs and Issues
If you have found something which appears to be a bug with the plugin rather than an error with your code, you can create a post in the issues section of this wiki.

[Issues](/../issues)

# Discord
You can join the MythicMobs Discord to gain access to the support chat where we can help you troubleshoot any issues you may come across or point you in the right direction for creating what you want. While we are always happy to help, we would appreciate it if you have tried to do it yourself, rather than just asking us to do it for you.
