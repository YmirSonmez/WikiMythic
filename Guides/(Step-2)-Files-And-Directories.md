Now that you understand what each thing is, you need to know where to put it!

The MythicMobs folder contains multiple subfolders each containing yaml files with your mobs, items, and spawns. You can also utilize [packs](/Packs) to organize things into their own mini directories.

Inside the MythicMobs folder you can find subfolders for each component of mythic. These folders can contain as many subfolders and .yml files as you like, and each file can contain as many mobs, items, randomspawnes etc as you like. You can also create folders inside a pack to store mobs in a pack.

Valid Examples of file paths:
- /plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/SkeletonKing.yml
- /plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/Skeletons/King.yml
- /plugins/MythicMobs/Packs/Skeletons/Mobs/King.yml
