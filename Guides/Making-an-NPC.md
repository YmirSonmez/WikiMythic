**Difficulty: Beginner**

Using a few basic tricks you can use MythicMobs to create highly versatile NPC's. The basic idea is to create a mob that has no AI/movement and doesn't despawn. We can then attach various mechanics and skills to our NPC mob such as messages, commands, or any skill you can think of.

# Step 1 - Basic NPC

The first step is simply making your mob file, this can be anywhere, for this example we'll make a NPC subfolder.

Using the below mob as a base, we can make a simple NPC that just stands still. We are using [LibsDisguises](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) to make the mob look like a player.

`plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/NPC/Steve.yml`

```yaml
NPC_Steve:
  Type: INTERACTION
  Display: 'Steve the Guide'
  Disguise: Player <Inherit> setSkin Steve setDynamicName true
  Options:
    AlwaysShowName: true
    Despawn: persistent
```

- `NPC_Steve` This is what you'll use to spawn your NPC. /mm m spawn NPC_Steve
- `Type: INTERACTION` You can use whatever you like but we'll be using an interaction entity since it has no AI, no sound etc.
- `Display: 'Steve the Guide'` This is what will appear above your NPC's head.
- `Disguise: Player <Inherit> setSkin Steve setDynamicName true` This is what makes our NPC look like a player. You can replace "Steve" with whatever player's skin you'd like to use. You must keep the setDynamicName as true so the NPC can use the Display setting. The `<Inherit>` (case-sensitive) placeholder sets the NPC to show its `Display:` name.  For more information about using custom skins [read here](/Mobs/Disguises).
- `AlwaysShowName: true` This makes the nameplate show above your NPC.
- `Despawn: persistent` This will keep your NPC spawned on reloads, restarts and chunk unloads.


# Step 2 - Adding messages and commands

You can add messages or commands to your NPC using the [Message](/Skills/mechanics/message) and [Command](/Skills/mechanics/command) mechanics. For this guide we will be using @trigger and onInteract which will show the message or run the command for a user who right clicks the NPC. When you are testing make sure you're in SURVIVAL mode as creative mode players wont be targetable.

### Message
This example will send a message to the player when they right click the NPC. We are adding the [Universal Attribute](Skills/Mechanics#universal-attributes) `cd=3` which will give it a cooldown of 3 seconds between clicks.
```yaml
  Skills:
  - message{m=&bWelcome to Hypixel &a<trigger.name>&b!;cd=3} @trigger ~onInteract
```

### Commands
This example will open a menu from DeluxeMenus for the player who right clicks the NPC.
```yaml
  Skills:
  - command{c="dm open shops-blocks <trigger.name>"} @trigger ~onInteract
```

You can add as many skills or mechanics as you like to your NPC, not just messages and commands. You can run any mechanic and any metaskill.


# Step 3 - ModelEngine (Optional)

If you want your NPC to use a ModelEngine model we can remove the disguise line and instead use 2 skills to apply a model to it. We will be using onSpawn and onLoad to make sure the model is always applied to the mob even after restarts. 

You will also need to add a nametag bone to your models to display the name above them. You can do this by opening your model in Blockbench and creating an empty bone and calling it `tag_name`, then upload the newly edited model to your Blueprints folder and use `/meg reload`.

 `plugins/MythicMobs/Mobs/NPC/Steve.yml`
```yaml
NPC_Steve:
  Type: INTERACTION
  Display: 'Steve'
  Options:
    AlwaysShowName: true
    Collidable: false
    Despawn: persistent
  Skills:
  - model{m=SteveModel;n=name;save=true} @self ~onSpawn
```

With the model mechanic the attributes are
- `m=SteveModel` This is where the name of your model goes, for example we have `plugins/ModelEngine/Blueprints/SteveModel.bbmodel`
- `n=name` This is the name of our [nametag bone](https://git.mythiccraft.io/mythiccraft/model-engine-4/-/wikis/Modeling/Bone-Behaviors#nametag) we created.
- `save=true` Tells ModelEngine that the model should be preserved, even across restarts


# Step 4 - Spawning the NPC

You can now use `/mm reload` to reload the modified files and add your NPC into the server. Simply stand where you want the NPC to be and use `/mm m spawn NPC_Steve`.

You now have a NPC created by MythicMobs.
