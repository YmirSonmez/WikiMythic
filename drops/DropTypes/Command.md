## Description
When dropped, a command is executed only once by the console, regardless of the amount specified.  
You can use caster-scoped and trigger-scoped placeholders to fetch information from the mob that dropped the command and the entity that killed it respectively.  
A `<drop.amount>` [placeholder](/Skills/Placeholders#misc-placeholders) can instead be used to fetch the original amount.
