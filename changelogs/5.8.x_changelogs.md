Random Spawning
---------------
- **Multiple Mobs with Weights**: You can now specify multiple mobs in a Random Spawner entry with weighted values, for example:
  ```yaml
  Deeps:
    Types:
    - RegularZombie 100
    - BigZombie 50
    - GiantZombie 5
    Worlds: world
    Chance: 0.1
    Priority: 1
    Action: ADD
    PositionType: LAND
  ```
- **Structures Support**: Added a `Structures:` list option allowing you to limit a Random Spawner to spawn mobs only in specific structures:
  ```yaml
  Nether_Fortress:
    Types:
    - blaze_wisp 100
    Worlds: world_nether
    Chance: 0.02
    Priority: 1

    Structures:
    - 'minecraft:fortress'

  ```

  - `RandomSpawning.MaxGenerationAttempts` to limit how many attempts the cluster generator tries when spawning.

- Various improvements to cluster generation and structure detection logic.
