### Better MetaSkills

 MetaSkills can now in many places be put in-line instead of having to
reference another skill. This means you will no longer have to make
multiple small skills in order to use certain complex meta-skills, such
as projectiles.

    

This is done by creating a new list of mechanics surrounded by square
brackets []s instead of putting a skill name. You can do this to nest
skills pretty much infinitely. Each new list of skills should be
properly indented to make sure YAML reads them correctly. 

    
    Skills:
    - projectile{
          interval=1; velocity=30; bulletType=BLOCK; material=MAGMA_BLOCK; tyo=0.5; g=1; bulletSpin=-40; hnp=true; stopatentity=false; duration=100;
          onHit=[
              - damage{amount=50}
              - ignite{ticks=20}
          ];
          onTick=[
              - particles{p=flame;a=20;hs=0.5;vs=0.5}
          ];
          onEnd=[
              - particles{p=largeexplode;a=50;speed=1;hs=0.05;vs=0.05}
              - effect:sound{s=entity.dragon_fireball.explode;p=0.6;v=2}
              - damage{amount=30} @ENO{r=5}
          ];
      } @targetlocation



### Math/Placeholders

 **This feature is Premium-only**.  You can now use math and
numeric placeholders in lots of places! The plan is to expand this to be
usable anywhere, but it's a big undertaking.  In order to use math
where able, you can simply put placeholders and equations between ''
where you'd normally put a number value.  For example:

    Skills:
    - damage{amount=1}
    - damage{amount='5 + 5'}
    - damage{amount='<caster.level> * 10'}

 and so on  The following mechanics can use math so far:

-   **damage**
-   **damagePercent**
-   **heal**
-   **healPercent**
-   **setLevel**

 Math is also usable in drop amounts:

    Drops:
    - gold_nugget '1 + (0.2 * <caster.level>)'



### Projectile Bullets

  Projectile mechanics can now specify a bullet type that will
represent the projectile. No longer are projectiles just limited to
particles!  These work with the projectile, missile, and orbital
mechanics.  Bullet types available are:

-   **ARROW** - *projectile{bulletType=ARROW;...}*
-   **BLOCK** - *projectile{bulletType=BLOCK;material=STONE;...}*
-   **ITEM** - *projectile{bulletType=ITEM;material=STONE;...}*
-   **MOB** - *projectile{bulletType=MOB;mob=SkeletonKing;...}*

 Yes, that's right, you can even shoot projectiles made up of other
Mythic mobs! Mobs shot with the projectile skill cannot be interacted
with, but will still use all their skills...  You can also use the
new **bulletSpin=#** option to give your bullets some spin. 

Mobs
----

 Added support for all 1.14 mob types. 

Mechanics
---------

 

### NEW: onShoot

 A special Aura mechanic that adds a temporary onShoot skill to the
target.

    Skills:
    - onShoot{auraName=fireball_bow;onShoot=[ shootfireball ];duration=200;charges=5} @self

 In this example, the caster's next 5 bow shots will shoot fireballs
instead of arrows. 

### NEW: Speak

 Speak is similar to the message skill, but is used for making mobs
"talk". Mobs will talk in the chat using a configured syntax, and if you
have a hologram plugin installed, they will also have speech bubbles!


     - speak{m="OH BOY I HAVE SPEECH BUBBLES NOW"} @trigger ~onInteract
     - speak{m="OW THAT HURTS I CANT BELIEVE YOU WOULD HIT AN INNOCENT MAN"} @trigger ~onDamaged
