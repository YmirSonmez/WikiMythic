**Highlights**
----------
- Added 1.18.1 support
- Bouncy projectiles
- A few bug fixes

General
-------
- Added 1.18.1 support
- Changed reload command to run async

Mechanics
---------
### Projectile
- Added **hugLiquid=true** option - when using hugSurface will also move on top of liquids.
- Added **bounce=true** option (premium-only)
- Added **bounceVelocityMod** option (defaults to 0.9)

Adding **bounce=true** will cause projectiles to bounce off of surfaces instead of just stopping. Every time it bounces, its velocity will be multiplied by _bounceVelocityMod_.

**The bounding box used for bouncing is calculated using the projectile's hit radius options, so if the projectile seems to be bouncing when it isn't close to a surface and you want more accuracy, try lowering the hit-radius!**

Calculating the physics for bouncing is quite intensive, so don't go too crazy with it on weaker servers!

### NEW: ConsumeSlot
- removes any item in the specified slot of the player's inventory.
  - `consumeslot{slot=25;amount=21} @PlayersInRadius{r=10}`

### NEW: TakeItem
